This release also includes upgraded Technology Preview of Knative Kafka Broker and Knative Kafa Sink.  Now you can create a Kafka Broker that uses an externally managed Kafka topic . Addition of monitoring dashboards for  visualizing Kafka Broker/Trigger and KafkaSink for Observability and ease of debugging. 
List of exposed dashboards:
Event Count (avg/sec, over 1m window)
Success Rate (2xx Event, fraction rate, over 1m window)
Event Count by Event Type (avg/sec, over 1m window)
Event Count by Response Code Class (avg/sec, over 1m window)
Failure Rate (non-2xx Event, fraction rate, over 1m window)
Event Dispatch Latency (ms)
For Serverless Functions/Knative Functions Tech Preview, s2i as a build strategy has been added, in addition to CNCF Buildpacks.

All the tested Cloud Provider(s) and Infrastructure can be found at our Supported Configuration page. Red Hat OpenShift Serverless is also  available on Developer Sandbox. Developer Sandbox is a sandbox OpenShift environment for accessing Red Hat products and technologies easily.

What are Serverless Functions/Knative Functions?
Technology Preview of Serverless functions/Knative Functions is a programming model that reduces programming complexities to make it attractive to even non developers, such as Data Scientist and Content Developers.  Serverless functions are shipped bundled with OpenShift Serverless and  offer local developer experience using Docker/Podman. In-cluster build using OpenShift Pipelines. We are striving to complete the Serverless offering with all the necessary constructs developers need to build modern cloud-native applications.  OpenShift Serverless functions OOTB runtimes including Quarkus, Node.js, Python, Go and Spring Boot, TypeScript, Rust. It offers multiple build strategies, s2i and CNCF Buildpacks. These functions can be invoked by plain HTTP Requests as well aWe are striving to complete the Serverless offering with all the necessary constructs developers need to build modern cloud-native applicationss Cloud Events by leveraging the Eventing component. Please find our Serverless functions documentation here
What is the difference between Serverless Containers and Serverless functions?
OpenShift Serverless is a deployment platform that runs your app containers and functions in Serverless manner, dynamically scaling up and down. We call this Serverless with flexibility
